An ATM seems like a really simple machine. We all know intuitively how it works: you give the machine money, and it adds that amount to your bank account. You ask the ATM for money and when it gives it to you, it removes that amount from your bank account. It seems pretty straight forward. 


### Get To Work

We've got you set up with a basic in-browser ATM. Take a look at `index.html` in both the text editor and the browser. You'll be coding your solution in `js/atm.js`.

Your job is to build a working ATM, where a user selects "deposit" or "withdraw" from the drop down menu and the amount of money. When they submit the form, the total in their bank account should change on the page. You will need to use functions in order to define clear actions for your work. jQuery will be helpful in submitting the form, as well as changing the total.
